    <p class="dropcap">San Francisco artist <strong><em>Andres Amador</em></strong> uses the beach as his canvas, racing against the tide to create these large scale temporary masterpieces using a rake or stick.A piece inspired by Mexican prehistoric art. It's done at Patzcuarito, a gorgeous beach south of Sayulita, Mexico. It's long and quite narrow, not so ideal for a design that needs a bit of spaciousness to be fully expressed.</p>

    <h2>Creating from imagination!</h2>
    
    <p>A piece <strong>inspired</strong> by Mexican prehistoric art. It's done at <em>Patzcuarito</em>, a gorgeous beach south of Sayulita, Mexico. It's long and quite narrow, not so ideal for a design that needs a bit of spaciousness to be fully expressed. Also, we're still getting a handle on the tide timing and we have been getting broadsided by the returning tide. </p>
   
    <h3><strong>Inspiration: Shine your light!</strong></h3>

    <h4>On Coast to Coast AM: Playa Painting 'Coriente'</h4>
    
    <img src="images/beach-art12.jpg" alt="Andres Amador">
   
    <p>In honour of being in <em>Mexico</em> and of being on a long, thin beach, here is a representation of Xiuhc√≥atl, the Aztec fire serpent, the light that drives out the darkness. While we were finishing, an elder who felt ancient yet vibrant came walking along the beach with his staff. It felt so beautiful and appropriate.</p>
